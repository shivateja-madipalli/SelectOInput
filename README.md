# Photo Carousel Replica
### A Frontend implementation of Carousel

----------

##### The app runs without any server and photos will not be saved.

###### How to run?
* A valid internet connection is required (as angular is fetched from a CDN).
* Clone the project and open index.html in any web browser.
* Add photos as required and by clicking next/prev the photo carousel can be viewed.

###### Example to save data:

* Name: Batman got some Science
* ImageURL: http://i.imgur.com/0IGbqui.jpg

![Submit New Image](/img/new_image.png?raw=true "")

and...

![Screen](/img/screen.png?raw=true "")

#### Scope for Enhancements

* Animation can be implemented.
* A Server to remember the state of the application.
* Saving the photos in any photo sharing application (by using their APIs).
* Responsive UI (currently it is semi responsive).
* CREATE AND UPDATE Operations to implement any filters or changing the text after saving the photo.
* Social Network Sharing capability.
